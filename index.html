                    <p>Sarah's journey began in the Appalachian mountains, where as a child she first experienced the divine through nature's embrace. It was here, among the green hills and flowing streams, that she formed her earliest understanding of spirituality - one that would sustain her through the darkest times.</p>
                    
                    <p>The contrast between the lush, vibrant East of her early childhood and the "brown, dead place" of the West where her family relocated created a spiritual wound that would take decades to heal. This geographical shift became a metaphor for her spiritual journey - a departure and eventual return to authentic connection.</p>
